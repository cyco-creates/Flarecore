# Design decisions (deltas from the build spec)

Decisions made with the project owner on 2026-09-04, deviating from or
extending the element math in the original build spec. Everything else follows
the spec as written.

## 1. Dispersion sign: red outermost

The spec's `scale_R = 1 + dispersion * k` applied to local coordinates renders
the red channel *smaller* (a feature at radius r appears at r / scale), putting
blue on the outside of dispersed elements. Real diffraction coronas and lens
ghost fringing put red outermost — longer wavelengths diffract more.

**Decision:** coefficients flipped. Red samples use coordinate scale
`1 - dispersion * k`, blue `1 + dispersion * k`, with `k = 0.05`.

## 2. Optional `dispersion_samples` element key

Three-sample RGB dispersion renders a high-dispersion element as three discrete
colored copies rather than a continuous rainbow. Real dispersion is a
continuum.

**Decision:** each element accepts an optional integer `dispersion_samples`
(default 3, minimum 3). At 3, behavior and cost are exactly the spec's R/G/B
path. Higher values evaluate N coordinate scales spanning the same ±dispersion
range, weighted by a piecewise-linear wavelength→RGB ramp that is normalized
per channel so total energy matches the 3-sample case. The `spectral` element
type defaults to 7 samples and `dispersion = 1.0`.

## 3. Iris edge model kept as specced (argument considered, rejected)

The `d = r / r_edge` angular-folding form makes the smoothstep edge band
physically wider at polygon corners than at edge midpoints. A true
perpendicular-distance SDF would make it uniform. Kept the spec form: real
iris blades are curved, so aperture ghosts genuinely have softer corners; the
"artifact" is the more physical look. `edge_softness` is clamped to a small
epsilon since the smoothstep degenerates at exactly zero.

## 4. Repo location

Repo root is `C:\WORK\Comfy_Flares\comfyui-flarecore`; the spec and planning
docs stay in `C:\WORK\Comfy_Flares\docs`.

## 5. Rotation units

Element `rotation` in presets is degrees (user-facing). Internal math is
radians.
